## :page_facing_up: User Story
- As a cake enthusiast, the user wants to explore a variety of delicious cakes and make a purchase through an intuitive app interface. So that the user can easily navigate and interact with the available options.

## :scream: Bugs to fix :poop:
- When the page width shrinks to less than 600px, the navigation bar becomes responsive, disappearing and displaying a hamburger icon instead. If the hamburger icon is clicked, the navigation bar will reappear, while the cake logo disappears, as designed. However, if the page width is then increased beyond 600px, two navigation bars will be displayed.
